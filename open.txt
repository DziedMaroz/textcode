Oh it's ever so funny
I don't think you're special
I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful

And I'm strugglin'
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, you know it for a fact
That everybody's eatin' out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you don't know nothing

Well fancy seein' you in here
You're all tarted up
And you don't look the same
Well I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah surprisingly
You have forgot my name

But you know it
Yeah, you knew it all along
Oh you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing
Go on tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing, no

I say what do you know?
That you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
I said what do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing

I fancy you with a passion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you

But it's alright, yeah I'll put it all on one-side
Oh 'cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine
