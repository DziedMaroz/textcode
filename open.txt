Oh it's ever so funny
I don't think you're special
I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful

And I'm strugglin'
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, you know it for a fact
That everybody's eatin' out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you don't know nothing
